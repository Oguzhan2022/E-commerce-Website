### Prerequisites

-   **Visual Studio** 2019 or later (with ASP.NET workload installed)
-   **Microsoft SQL Server** (and SQL Server Management Studio or a similar tool)

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Oguzhan2022/E-commerce-Website.git
    ```

2.  **Open the solution in Visual Studio:**
    -   Navigate to the cloned directory and open the `Larana.sln` file.

3.  **Set up the database:**
    -   This project uses `.dacpac` files for database deployment. You need to publish them to your local SQL Server instance.
    -   Open your SQL Server management tool (like SSMS).
    -   Create two new empty databases (e.g., `LaranaDB` and `LaranaAccountDB`).
    -   Right-click on each database and select **Tasks -> Deploy Data-tier Application...**
    -   Browse for and select the corresponding `.dacpac` files from the project's root directory:
        -   `LaranaDB.dacpac`
        -   `Larana.Models.DbAccount.dacpac`
    -   Follow the wizard to complete the deployment.

4.  **Update the Connection Strings:**
    -   In the `Web.config` file within the `Larana` project, find the `<connectionStrings>` section.
    -   Update the connection strings to point to your local SQL Server instance and the databases you just created.

5.  **Build and Run the project:**
    -   Build the solution in Visual Studio to restore NuGet packages.
    -   Press `F5` or click the "Start" button to launch the website in your browser.
